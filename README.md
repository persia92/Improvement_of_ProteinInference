Improvement_of_ProteinInference
===============================

ProteinInference
-------------------------------------------------------
To Run the Project:
 - Open the project in Netbeans IDE
 - Build and Run the project

Input:
 - Folder sigmaTestData contains input file "test_peptide_44_proteins.txt" for running the test
 - File Format, Actual proteins:Test peptides

Output:
 - Folder sigmaTestResult contains output file "test_peptide_44_proteins_derived_with_contraint.txt"
 - File Format: Iteration no, Epsilon, AvgTP, AvgFP, AvgFN, AvgPrecision, AvgRecall, AvgFmeans

 
.............................Project Folder(Source code)...............

1. magpi_database_map.txt : 
 - It is working as Database in our code
 - Format of this database is protein<space>peptide 

2. In Test_peptide Generations folder, test peptide making process is given(readme.txt has been included).

3. In Mapping folder, mapping procedure is given(readme.txt has been included).
