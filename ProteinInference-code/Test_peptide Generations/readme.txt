Generate_test_peptide_44_proteins.cpp : Generating peptides, comes from MSBayesPro whose protein MAP are 1.
Here input is det2_peptide_map.txt and magpi_database.txt files which are taken from Mapping folder. the output is sigma_peptide_gibbs.txt


Now, test_peptide_44_proteins.txt is in this promate pro1,pro2... : pep1,pep2.... 

here,
pep1,pep2.... : is the sample peptides. It is going to be tested.
pro1,pro2...  : is the actual protein set of 44 proteins of sigma49 dataset.
